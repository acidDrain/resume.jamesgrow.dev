        <p>
          I've made a transition from a leadership role into the principal
          technical role in the organization.
        </p>
        <p>

            Compliance automation solution using Open Policy Agent and
            Policy-As-Code (written in Rego) to check Terraform plans in the
            CI/CD pipeline against NIST 800-53.
          </p>
          <p>
            The solution provided a gatekeeper to the CI/CD pipeline that failed
            the build/prevented deployment when a Terraform plan was evaluated
            to be out of compliance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The solution also provided feedback to developers/engineers listing
            the specific parts of the Terraform plan that were out of compliance
            with references to the related NIST 800-53 controls.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the findings were addressed and brought back into compliance,
            resulting in an passing evaluation, the deployment would be
            authorized to continue.
          </p>
          <h5>Background</h5>
          <p>
            Government contractor with NIST 800-53/Fedramp requirements needing
            a solution to help ease the burden of compliance audit and controls
            for their cloud infrastructure.
          </p>
          <h5>Requirements and Features</h5>
          <p>The solution should</p>
          <ul>
            <li>integrate with the CI/CD pipeline</li>
            <li>integrate with Terraform</li>
            <li>enable rich expression of policy</li>
            <li>be platform agnostic</li>
            <li>
              provide fast and rich feedback to developers/engineers to enable
              self-service - allowing engineers to identify and resolve findings
              immediately
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Design</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              First, we identified the technical controls from NIST 800-53
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Of those technical controls, we identified controls that were
                  applicable to the cloud deployment/environment (run time
                  checks were not in scope, for example)
                </li>
                <li>
                  finally we designed a tagging and classification strategy to
                  describe the systems, applications, environments, and data to
                  adequately model in the policy language
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Translated controls into policy code, modeling relationships in
              data using the tagging and classification strategy we developed
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed Terraform module examples that passed policy evaluation
              and could be added to a library of reusable infrastructure
              components.
            </li>
            <li>
              Deployed the Open Policy Agent service running as a container in
              Kubernetes
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed CI scripts used to retrieve the Terraform plan from
              Terraform Cloud and subsequently submit to the Open Policy Agent
              API for evaluation
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The underlying tech stack I used to build the solution:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>NIST 800-53 / Fedramp</li>
            <li>Open Policy Agent / Rego</li>
            <li>Kubernetes</li>
            <li>Terraform</li>
            <li>Microsoft Azure (cloud provider)</li>

          <p>
            Scanning-as-a-Service API written in JavaScript (Typescript) for
            creating vulnerability scanning jobs of AMIs (Amazon Machine
            Images).
          </p>
          <h5>Background</h5>
          <p>
            Client (health information technology services) adopted
            infrastructure-as-code early on, allowing development teams to
            produce their own golden AMIs for their respective software stacks.
            Instead of logging in to individual EC2 instances to make changes or
            run updates, they would have their CI/CD Pipeline build a new golden
            AMI using HashiCorp's Packer tool, then re-deploy their instances
            from the AMI.
          </p>
          <p>
            The client was looking for a solution that could take webhooks from
            their CI/CD pipeline to handle vulnerability scanning of each new
            AMI produced while abstracting the underlying scanning solution
            behind the API.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal was to produce a platform agnostic, custom implementation
            of the concept outlined in How to Set Up Continuous Golden AMI
            Vulnerability Assessments with Amazon Inspector
          </p>
          <h5>Requirements and Features</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The solution must be stateless: state should be tracked/stored
              within components of the solution concerned with persistence
            </li>
            <li>The solution must scale horizontally</li>
            <li>
              The solution must be idempotent - adding more instances of the API
              should not have any effect on overall operations
            </li>
            <li>
              The solution must be asynchronous to avoid being a bottleneck or
              blocker
            </li>
            <li>
              The solution must be portable to support potential separate,
              independent deployments
            </li>
            <li>
              The solution must be event driven - its actions are in response to
              something happening (e.g. a new request to scan an AMI, a failure
              to connect to another API, etc.)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Design</h5>
          <p>
            The solution was built platform agnostic. AWS, GCP, Azure, VMware,
            etc. for the initial roadmap, with AWS being the initial cloud
            platform supported in MVP.
          </p>

          <p>
            The underlying vulnerability scanning solution was Tenable.io, using
            a Nessus scanner deployed locally to the VPC.
          </p>

          <p>The underlying tech stack I used to build the solution:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Written in Typescript (only external dependencies were Express.js
              and AWS SDK)
            </li>
            <li>Containerized, deployed to Kubernetes running in EC2</li>
            <li>RabbitMQ - for distributed messaging and queuing</li>
            <li>CouchDB - job persistence and tracking</li>
            <li>

              long-term
